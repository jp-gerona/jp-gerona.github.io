#  LT1: Personal Website 

### 1. How you accomplished each item in the criteria.

- **Applications of Concepts Taught:** The learning tasks gave me a quick refresher on HTML and CSS. I have made good use of various CSS selectors in styling my HTML elements. Git was definitely helpful as I made extensive use of Git commands and GitHub. Additionally, Flexbox Froggy helped me a lot in understanding more about flexbox layouting which helped me visualize and apply the responsive lay-out of my website easier. Lastly, I introduced a little bit of JavaScript (even if they are not part of the criteria) just to make the website a bit more interesting and interactive.

- **Design:** Before I started working on my website, the first thing that pop to my mind was setting up the color palette and personal design system to keep me guided. I based my design on the character that I frequently use as a profile picture, which is made by vacuumch. I would say that I chose a minimalist and clean design to keep it simple yet elegant. I also made sure to keep things consistent throughout the website.

- **Content:** Thanks to one course I had last semester, I already have a general idea and a resume on the content that I will add to my website. However, I made sure to add relevant details and personalize it more to reflect my interests and personality. I also included a short bio to give visitors a glimpse of who I am.

- **Creativity:** Seeing the words "Personal Website", I just know that I had to get my creativity flowing. I took inspiration from sites at [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/). Even though I was leaning to a minimalist design, I made extensive use of gradients to make my website pop.

- **Deployment:** I deployed my website using GitHub Pages. This allowed me to easily host my site for free and have it accessible at my custom domain name. Additionally, I made extensive use of the Live Server Extension to view the changes I made to my website using localhost before committing/pushing any final changes.

### 2. Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2

- While doing the tasks, I became more familiar with how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are structured and work together to build creative and interactive websites. 

### 3. Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2

- I struggled a bit with **Media Queries**, as I had to use the !important as a last resort to override some CSS styles that are not being cascaded. Another thing I struggled with is the **lay-out of the website**, I had to play around with properties and values to get what I want.

### 4. How you could improve your website in the future

- To improve my website better, the introduction of **more JavaScript** would make the website more interactive. I also need to work more on its **responsiveness** if I do get the chance (such as hovers being only available to desktop and not for mobile), but I think everything seems to work fine in my end.

### 5. Other thoughts that might be noteworthy

- Like technology, Web Design is constantly evolving: design trends and techniques change over time. Which is why practice and experimentation is necessary in order to adapt and improve. I aim to keep learning and improving my skills to create better websites that are aesthetically pleasing, functionally useful and accessible for all.
